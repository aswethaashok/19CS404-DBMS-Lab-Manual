# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## 🎯 Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## 📚 Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

---

## 🧪 Choose One Scenario:

### 🔹 Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## 📝 Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## ER Diagram:

## Entities and Attributes:

### Patient

* PatientID (PK)

* FullName

* DOB

* Gender

* Address

* Phone

* Email

* InsuranceDetails

### Doctor

* DoctorID (PK)

* FullName

* Specialization

* Phone

* Email

* ScheduleDetails

### Department

* DepartmentID (PK)

* DepartmentName

* DepartmentHead

### Appointment

* AppointmentID (PK)

* AppointmentDateTime

* Reason

* Notes

* FK: PatientID

* FK: DoctorID

### MedicalRecord

* MedicalRecordID (PK)

* Diagnosis

* Medications

* Treatments

* TestResults

* VisitDate

* FK: PatientID

* FK: DoctorID

### Billing

* BillingID (PK)

* AppointmentID (FK)

* TotalAmount

* Status (Paid/Unpaid)

* BillingDate

### Payment

* PaymentID (PK)

* BillingID (FK)

* PaymentMode (Cash/Card/Online)

* PaymentDate

* AmountPaid





## Relationships and Constraints:

### Relationships

* Department — Doctor: 1 to Many

* Doctor — Appointment — Patient: Many to Many (via Appointment)

* Patient — MedicalRecord — Doctor: Many to Many

* Appointment — Billing: 1 to 1

* Billing — Payment: 1 to Many (Installments possible)

### Cardinality & Constraints

* Every Appointment is between 1 Doctor and 1 Patient.

* A Billing record is created per appointment.

* A Payment may be split into multiple records.


## Extension (Prerequisite / Billing):

### Extension: Billing and Payment

#### New Entity: Bill

* Attributes: BillID (PK), DateIssued, TotalAmount, Status (e.g., Paid/Unpaid), PaymentMethod

* Relationship: Generates between Appointment and Bill

* One appointment generates one bill, so it’s a 1:1 relationship.

### Optional Extension:

* Add a Payment entity if tracking partial payments or transactions is needed.

* Attributes: PaymentID, AmountPaid, DatePaid, PaymentMethod

* Relationship: One Bill → Many Payments (1:N)

### Design Justification:

* Keeping Bill as a separate entity allows tracking financial data without overloading the Appointment entity.

* Makes it flexible to manage payments, receipts, and outstanding dues.

## Design Choices:

### Entity Choices and Justifications

#### Patient

* Chosen to represent individuals receiving care.

* Attributes like PatientID, Name, DOB, and InsuranceDetails are critical for identity, communication, and billing.

#### Doctor

* Represents healthcare providers.

* DoctorID, Specialization, and WorkSchedule support patient assignment, filtering, and appointments.

#### Department

* Provides organizational structure (e.g., Cardiology).

* Allows grouping doctors under departments and supports departmental management.

#### Appointment

* Captures interaction between a patient and doctor.

* It’s a many-to-many relationship (a patient may meet many doctors, and doctors consult many patients), resolved as an entity with AppointmentID, DateTime, etc.

#### MedicalRecord

* Tracks clinical data (diagnosis, medications, test results).

* Linked to both Patient and Doctor to preserve accountability and medical history.

#### Bill

* Introduced to track financial transactions.

* Associated with Appointment since billing is usually appointment-based.

* Supports attributes such as TotalAmount, PaymentMethod, and Status.

#### Payment

* Represents actual financial transaction(s) against a bill.

* Allows multiple payments per bill (e.g., installments, partial payments).

* Attributes: PaymentID, BillID, PaymentDate, AmountPaid, PaymentMethod.

### Relationship Choices and Assumptions

#### Patient – Appointment – Doctor

* Modeled via the Appointment entity to capture the many-to-many relationship.

* Includes attributes like ReasonForVisit, Date, and Time.

* A patient can have multiple appointments with different doctors.

#### Doctor – Department

* A department can have many doctors (1:N).

* Each doctor is assigned to one department.

#### MedicalRecord – Patient & Doctor

* MedicalRecord is created for each appointment, linking a specific patient and doctor.

* Relationship: N:1 for both patient and doctor sides.

* Captures diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatments.

#### Appointment – Bill

* Every appointment results in exactly one bill (1:1).

* The Bill entity stores total charges and billing status for the services provided.

#### Bill – Payment

* Each bill can be settled through one or more payments (1:N).

* The Payment entity includes attributes like AmountPaid, PaymentDate, and PaymentMethod.

* Supports partial payments, insurance co-pays, or installments.

### Key Assumptions

* Every patient visit must have a corresponding appointment.

* A bill is always generated for an appointment (even if free, for record-keeping).

* Medical records are visit-based, not cumulative.

* Payment tracking (e.g., partial payments, refunds) can be optionally extended by adding a Payment entity.


## RESULT
   Successfully designed an ER diagram for the Hospital Database with entities, relationships, constraints, and billing-extension using the Payment entity to support real-world healthcare operations.
